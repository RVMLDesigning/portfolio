# Questioning Kit


## What was this project about?
Questioning is a skill essential for all. We are all born with questioning that slowly vanishes as we go through school, college and finally join workforce. The project aims to create a hands-on tool to enable practice of questioning through play.


## What did I realize?

* Generating multiple options is useful.
* Questioning with the client to understand better is essential.
* Play testing and using a thing I created felt good.


## Feedback
* Founder:  She worked with me to understand how I wanted the kit to be. Her questions helped me think and express things better. Her attention to detail, whether it is in prototyping quickly or testing thoroughly, is helpful. The sketches she showed me and final designs were to my satisfaction. 

* Parent: The kit is a nice idea. The family game was fun and we played few rounds. I think my 4 year old and 6 year old will love this.

* 13 year old child: I love this kit as I can print and decorate it the way I want. I enjoyed playing games with my family and use it for my reflections at the end of week at school.

* Adult in IT industry: I printed and tried using stickies. I realized that I can generate lot more questions quickly. This helps me a lot!


## What did I do?

I started with a puzzle based approach to play test it. Based on the experience, I lead a brainstorming session that resulted in Cards and Dice as inspiration. Initial prototype was made out of sticky notes and multiple iterations lead to a version that was printed on card stock for regular using. The kit was also shared with families and adults in the network for testing. The initial dice version was made using wooden blocks and paper. After enough usage and testing, a vendor was chosen to print it and similarly for the dice version.
