# Toy Design

![TopArt poster](artifacts/Poster-ToyDesign.png){:width="300", :height="464"}

## What was this project about?

Research toy market and trends. Choose an age group and target market to design a toy that has higher play value. 

## What did I realize?

* Analyzing a toy from the structure (how to use, feedback, mechanism and purpose) helps in creating variations.
* Prototyping and failing fast is important.
* Creating a first version makes things concrete for all.
* Testing and revising is essential.

## Feedback
* Professor: I like that you prototyped extensively and iterated your designs. Thanks again for your impressive effort, attention and your key reflections!

* Parent: Thank you for sharing this with my family! My children spent hours playing with it creating patterns and trying out different things.

* A 6 year old Child: I love the patterns that I made. I had lots of fun!

## What did I do?

I analyzed toys from my childhood and other popular toys using few frameworks (use, feedback, mechanism and purpose) to understand them. Using the fundamental questioning I got a sense of different types of toys and who they are positioned for. 

Then I decided on focusing on specific age group and used few techniques to come up with few concepts to explore. I prototyped few to get a sense before narrowing down to one concept to develop further. I reached out to 5 - 8 families with children to seek feedback to tweak my designs.
