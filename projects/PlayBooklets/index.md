# Play Booklet series 


## What was this project about?
The intent was to create a play book (Practice through Play) that one engages through play all the while practicing essential skills. 


## What did I realize?

* Designing experience that encourages play and leads to learning is challenging.
* Play testing the creations was fun and led to lots of insights.
* Feedback from families and children was encouraging that this series has potential.

## Feedback
* Founder:  She is a hard worker, open to changes and is flexible. She worked with me to determine the brief - reframing what it could be better. The final design was to my satisfaction.

* Parent: The series was vey interesting way to introduce my children to different concepts. My children enjoyed the series and learnt a lot through the process.


## What did I do?

From the brief I worked on creating different booklet series - What if?, Frame, Connect, that adapted world building and association techniques for kids to break the current paradigm and explore. I started with understanding the brief, who my client is, who is it for, the age range and what is the topic. After understanding the topic I broke down into different parts - the core components and how it can be simplified. Then I focused on designing the experience - how they get to know, how they get started, the core message, key reflections and realizations. I designed the guide through the journey.
