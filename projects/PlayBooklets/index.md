## Feedback
* _Founder_:  I see you as hard working and open to feedback. You worked with me to determine the what I had in mind and helped me articulate it better. The final design was to my satisfaction.
* _Parent_: The series was vey interesting way to introduce my children to different concepts. My children enjoyed the series and learnt a lot through the process.


## What did I do?

From the brief I worked on creating different booklet series - What if?, Frame, Connect, that adapted world building and association techniques for kids to break the current paradigm and explore. I started with understanding the brief, who my client is, who is it for, the age range and what is the topic. After understanding the topic I broke down into different parts - the core components and how it can be simplified. Then I focused on designing the experience - how they get to know, how they get started, the core message, key reflections and realizations. I designed the guide through the journey.
