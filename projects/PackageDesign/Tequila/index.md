## Feedback

* _Professor_: Great work! Nice work on the typoe -- kind of classic but the copper adds a nice toucch and definitely has quiality ssophhisticated feel - could be edgier.

## What did I do?

I started with analysing the brief and trying out different concepts and immediately communicating with the client to understand the needs of the brand. I worked on big concepts and then I worked on finalizing the font, type face, color and seasonal versions. At every stage there was a client meet to understand if the requirements were met and changes were done accordingly.
