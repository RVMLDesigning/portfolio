# Tequila - 55 Patron


## What was this project about?
The client is about to launch a new special edition tequila into the Canadian marketplace. The product is aimed at a younger audience to be consumed while hanging out with friend,s pre-dinner or while watching sports at home. The intent is to design a packaging for this project.


## What did I realize?

* Good design is minimal. Keep it simple. 
* Understanding and communicating with the client at every stage is important.
* Articulating ideas and listening, noting down ideas is very important.

## Feedback

* Professor: Great work! Nice work on the typoe -- kind of classic but the copper adds a nice toucch and definitely has quiality ssophhisticated feel - could be edgier.

## What did I do?

I started with analysing the brief and trying out different concepts and immediately communicating with the client to understand the needs of the brand. I worked on big concepts and then I worked on finalizing the font, type face, color and seasonal versions. At every stage there was a client meet to understand if the requirements were met and changes were done accordingly.
