## Feedback

* Professor: You did a great job every week by showcasing your work. You listened and took the feedback to refine. Great designers are great listeners. Remember to keep things simple -- too much coming at people these days. Nice color palette.

* Retail shop owner: I think this will stand out well in my shop.

* Retail shopper: I love the look and it is inviting.


## What did I do?

I analyzed the brief throughly through 4Wâ€™s method understanding the client and user needs. I visited 4-5 stores around my area to observe and take pictures of various offerings. I came up with a series of ideas as sketches to solicit feedback. Eventually choose one concept and I continued to work on the concept tweaking every week. At first I focussed on the overall big picture - font combined with cycle and popcorn for wheels - a fun and modern concept. With feedback I went through different iterations. I keenly listened to the clients feedback and tweaked accordingly. 

Then I focused on the font type - exploring different fonts and sketching various alternatives. With feedback I tweaked over few iterations.
